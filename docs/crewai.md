# CrewAI Implementation

## What is CrewAI?
CrewAI is a Python framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents that work together to solve complex tasks. It provides both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control, making it ideal for creating specialized AI teams.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Operation**: Agents make intelligent decisions based on their roles and available tools
- **Natural Interaction**: Agents communicate and collaborate like human team members
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new tools, roles, and capabilities
- **Production Ready**: Built for reliability and scalability
- **Security-Focused**: Designed with enterprise security requirements
- **Cost-Efficient**: Optimized to minimize token usage and API calls

## Implementation Approach

### Crews for Complex Tasks
Used for tasks requiring creative thinking and adaptation:
- Medical conversation analysis
- Clinical information extraction
- Patient language assessment
- Quality control and validation

### Flows for Structured Processes
Used for deterministic, auditable workflows:
- Data processing pipelines
- Audit logging
- Database operations
- API integrations

## Code Examples

### Agent Definition
```python
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class MedicalPreprocessor(Agent):
    def __init__(self, llm):
        super().__init__(
            role='Medical Preprocessor',
            goal='Analyze and prepare medical conversations for processing',
            backstory='Expert in medical terminology and conversation analysis',
            llm=llm,
            tools=[MedicalTerminologyTool(), ContextAnalyzerTool()]
        )
```

### Tool Implementation
```python
from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class MedicalTerminologyTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "medical_terminology"
    description: str = "Tool for analyzing and simplifying medical terminology"
    
    class InputSchema(BaseModel):
        text: str = Field(..., description="Medical text to analyze")
        
    def _run(self, text: str) -> str:
        # Implementation here
        return simplified_text
```

### Task Definition
```python
from crewai import Task

preprocessing_task = Task(
    description='Process and analyze the medical conversation',
    agent=preprocessing_agent,
    expected_output='Structured medical conversation with identified key elements'
)
```

### Crew Configuration
```python
from crewai import Crew

medical_crew = Crew(
    agents=[preprocessing_agent, language_assessor, clinical_extractor],
    tasks=[preprocessing_task, assessment_task, extraction_task],
    process='sequential'  # or 'hierarchical'
)
```

### YAML Configuration
```yaml
crew:
  name: "Medical Processing Crew"
  agents:
    - name: "preprocessor"
      role: "Medical Preprocessor"
      goal: "Analyze and prepare medical conversations"
      backstory: "Expert in medical terminology"
      tools:
        - "medical_terminology"
        - "context_analyzer"
    - name: "language_assessor"
      role: "Language Assessment Specialist"
      goal: "Assess patient language proficiency"
      backstory: "Expert in language assessment"
      tools:
        - "language_analyzer"
        - "literacy_assessor"
  tasks:
    - name: "preprocessing"
      description: "Process medical conversation"
      agent: "preprocessor"
    - name: "assessment"
      description: "Assess language proficiency"
      agent: "language_assessor"
  process: "sequential"
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Design
- Define clear roles and goals
- Provide comprehensive backstories
- Equip with appropriate tools
- Set proper delegation permissions

### Tool Implementation
- Inherit from `BaseTool`
- Define clear input schemas
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive documentation

### Task Management
- Break down complex tasks
- Define clear success criteria
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor token usage

### Security & Compliance
- Use local LLMs for sensitive data
- Implement proper audit logging
- Follow HIPAA guidelines
- Validate all outputs

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate LLM types
- Implement caching where possible
- Monitor resource usage
- Scale based on demand

# Healthcare Multi-Agent System - Development Progress

## Project Description

A proof-of-concept multi-agent LLM system to support healthcare professionals in communication with patients and colleagues. The system helps healthcare professionals adapt their communication style based on patient characteristics and provides real-time assistance during consultations.

### Key Features
- **Patient-Centric Communication**: Real-time suggestions for adapting language based on patient characteristics
- **Clinical Documentation Support**: Automated assistance with SOAP notes, terminology simplification, and multilingual documentation
- **Quality Improvement**: Real-time feedback on communication effectiveness and documentation completeness

## Development Decisions

### Functional Decisions
- **Scope**: Focus on proof-of-concept implementation with simulated data
- **Scalability**: Out-of-scope for initial version; focus on core functionality
- **Data Privacy**: Use local LLMs (Ollama) for sensitive data processing
- **Integration**: Design for future integration with healthcare systems

### Technical Decisions
- **Framework**: Use CrewAI for agent orchestration
- **LLM Providers**: Support both OpenAI and Ollama
- **Coding Standards**: 
  - Python: Ruff-compatible code style
  - Markdown: Line wrapping at 132 characters
  - Type hints: Required for all function parameters and return values
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and LLM-specific tests
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for all components

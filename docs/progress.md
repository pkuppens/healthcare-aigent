# Healthcare Multi-Agent System - Development Progress

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a healthcare multi-agent system that can assist healthcare professionals in various tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. The system will use multiple AI agents, each specialized in a specific domain, working together to provide comprehensive healthcare assistance.

### Key Features
- **Patient-Centric Communication**: Real-time suggestions for adapting language based on patient characteristics
- **Clinical Documentation Support**: Automated assistance with SOAP notes, terminology simplification, and multilingual documentation
- **Quality Improvement**: Real-time feedback on communication effectiveness and documentation completeness

## Development Decisions

### Functional Decisions

- **Scope**: Focus on proof-of-concept implementation, fill in gaps with simulated data
- **Scalability**: Out-of-scope for initial version; focus on core functionality
- **Data Privacy**: Use local LLMs (Ollama) for sensitive data processing, and anonymize PII data before sending to Cloud LLMs for complex operations.
- **Integration**: Design for future integration with healthcare systems
- **Auditing/Traceability**: Design extensive logging to meet auditing and traceability requirements in AI healthcare.
- The system will use a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for different healthcare domains.
- Agents will communicate with each other to share information and collaborate on tasks.

### Technical Decisions

- **Programming Languages**: Python will be used as the primary programming language for the backend, JavaScript for the frontend.
- **Framework**: Use CrewAI for agent orchestration
- **LLM Providers**: Support at least OpenAI and Ollama, and stay flexible to adopt Gemini, Grok, Claude with MCP, etc.
- **Coding Standards**: 
  - Python: Ruff-compatible code style
  - Markdown: Line wrapping at 100 characters
  - Type hints: Required for all function parameters and return values
- **Testing Strategy**: Test driven development, with comprehensive unit, integration, and LLM-specific tests
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for all components, update the documentation during development.

## Development Strategy

Our development approach follows these key principles:

1. **One Task at a Time**: Focus on completing a single task before moving to the next to maintain clarity and progress.
2. **Task Refinement and Breakdown**: Before implementation, tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable components with clear requirements.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing functionality to ensure code meets requirements and maintains quality.
4. **Documentation-First**: Update documentation as part of the development process, not as an afterthought.
5. **Incremental Progress**: Make small, verifiable changes that build toward the larger goal.

This strategy ensures consistent progress, maintainable code, and clear documentation throughout the development process.

## File Management

This progress file is designed to be updated throughout the development process. Cursor AI is explicitly allowed and encouraged to update this file when:
- Completing coding tasks
- Making new technical decisions
- Identifying additional requirements
- Adding new tasks or subtasks
- Marking tasks as completed

The file should be kept up-to-date to reflect the current state of the project and serve as a reference for future development.
Additions are welcome, rewrites should be limited, to keep reviewing and version control simple.

# Healthcare Multi-Agent System - Development Progress

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a healthcare multi-agent system that can assist healthcare professionals in various tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. The system will use multiple AI agents, each specialized in a specific domain, working together to provide comprehensive healthcare assistance.

### Key Features
- **Patient-Centric Communication**: Real-time suggestions for adapting language based on patient characteristics
- **Clinical Documentation Support**: Automated assistance with SOAP notes, terminology simplification, and multilingual documentation
- **Quality Improvement**: Real-time feedback on communication effectiveness and documentation completeness

## Development Decisions

### Functional Decisions

- **Scope**: Focus on proof-of-concept implementation, fill in gaps with simulated data
- **Scalability**: Out-of-scope for initial version; focus on core functionality
- **Data Privacy**: Use local LLMs (Ollama) for sensitive data processing, and anonymize PII data before sending to Cloud LLMs for complex operations.
- **Integration**: Design for future integration with healthcare systems
- **Auditing/Traceability**: Design extensive logging to meet auditing and traceability requirements in AI healthcare.
- The system will use a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for different healthcare domains.
- Agents will communicate with each other to share information and collaborate on tasks.

### Technical Decisions

- **Programming Languages**: Python will be used as the primary programming language for the backend, JavaScript for the frontend.
- **Framework**: Use CrewAI for agent orchestration.
- **LLM Providers**: Support at least OpenAI and Ollama, and stay flexible to adopt Gemini, Grok, Claude with MCP, etc.
- **Coding Standards**: 
  - Python: Ruff-compatible code style
  - Markdown: Line wrapping at 100 characters
  - Type hints: Required for all function parameters and return values
- **Architecture**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Testing Strategy**: Test driven development, with comprehensive unit, integration, and LLM-specific tests, using Pytest
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for all components, update the documentation during development.

## Development Strategy

Our development approach follows these key principles:

### Task Management Strategy

1. **One Task at a Time**: Focus on completing a single task before moving to the next to maintain clarity and progress.
2. **Task Refinement and Breakdown**: Before implementation, tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable components with clear requirements.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing functionality to ensure code meets requirements and maintains quality.
4. **Documentation-First**: Update documentation as part of the development process, not as an afterthought.
5. **Incremental Progress**: Make small, verifiable changes that build toward the larger goal.

### Coding Strategy

1. Define interfaces and base classes
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add tests for each component
4. Integrate components
5. Add fallback mechanisms
6. Document the system

This strategy ensures consistent progress, maintainable code, and clear documentation throughout the development process.

## File Management

This progress file is designed to be updated throughout the development process.

Cursor AI is explicitly allowed to make small updates to this file when:

- Making new technical decisions
- Identifying additional requirements
- Adding new tasks or subtasks
- Completing coding tasks
- Marking tasks as completed

The file should be kept up-to-date to reflect the current state of the project and serve as a reference for future development.
Additions are welcome, rewrites should be limited, to keep reviewing and version control simple.

## In Progress

### LangFlow Proof-of-Concept Investigation

#### Functional Description
Evaluate LangFlow as an alternative to CrewAI for orchestrating our healthcare multi-agent system,
focusing on its ability to handle local LLM integration, patient preference adaptation, and
workflow management. The proof-of-concept will demonstrate how different patient preferences can
lead to different communication outputs for the same medical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Working proof-of-concept that uses LangFlow to orchestrate a simple healthcare communication workflow
- Integration with local Ollama LLMs for text generation
- Mock patient database with preference settings
- Demonstration of preference-based output adaptation
- Decision recommendation based on technical feasibility and maintainability

Out of scope:
- Production-ready implementation
- Integration with real healthcare systems
- Complex multi-agent interactions
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

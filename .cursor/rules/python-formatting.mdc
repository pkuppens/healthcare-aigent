# Python Formatting and Linting

- Use `Ruff` for all Python code formatting and linting, following the rules in @pyproject.toml
- Run `ruff format` and `ruff check --fix` on any code you modify
- Adhere to a maximum line length of 132 characters
- All new functions, methods, and variables must include type hints using the standard `typing` module
- If `ruff` requires using `dict` instead of `Dict`, follow that rule
